## Chapter 1
### tuning applicatio perfomance 
- performance testing
- load testing 
- stress tesing
#### perfromance tesing 
start with few users then start increase concurrent user that access our website 
this type of testing has number of assess
- response times 
- system usage patterns such as 
- CPU usage, memory usage, request execution time
### load tesing 
 we want to see how our application reacts executing tests against system at high load level
 and by this testing we can determine varity of system characterstics 
 - reliability
 - robustness
 - availability
 ### stress testng 
 answer ths question What happens if the system gets overloaded with requests? Will it stop functioning
 this same as load testing but this take load level to extreme 
 Does the application refuse requests and 
then recover gracefully after a short period

### summary
important of clean architecture can help us if we want to tuning
There are many good practices to utilize when it comes to flexible, easy-to-test solutions, 
including inversion of control (IoC), design patterns, and tiered architecture,
